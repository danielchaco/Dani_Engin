# RoadEngin

From simple RGB images or complex images such as 3D 
or laser-based images, we can accurately detect the existing
distresses noticed on the pavement surface with their typology
and severity. We can detect as well the condition of 
infrastructure elements such as striping, manhole, drainage, etc.

Although processes are similar between providers, metadata and
camera configuration require to manage the postprocessing independently.
Therefore, general functions are placed in the `utils` folder,
and particular applications and/or functions will be developed in
their own folders.
