# Engin.AI tools
by Daniel M Chacon

The results of our AI models require an extra processing to
meet technical requirements such as independency of same 
category due to geometry, and unification of a distress 
typology or severity in case of multiple detections nearby a
region.

Other tools are related to the conversion of Engin.AI categories
to the different standards, the computation of indices, and the
generation of reports.

Each tool has been developed from the point of view of a Civil
Engineer according to the different main products developed at
Engin.AI.

## Products

- **RoadEngin**: Automation of distress rating processing based on
image recordings.
- **TrafficControl**: Vehicle and pedestrian counting on traffic 
light intersections.
- **BackCalculation**: Computation of modulus of n-layers of an
asphalt pavement structure, based on soil classification, back-
calculation, and a database.
